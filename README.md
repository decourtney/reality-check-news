## Description

Reality Check News is a revolutionary social media platform that reimagines the way we consume and interact with news. Unlike traditional news outlets, we empower registered content creators to shape the narrative by sharing articles, videos, images, and more. What sets us apart is our unique rating system, which ensures that quality content rises to the top.

Our platform fosters a dynamic ecosystem where content creators' ratings evolve based on their past work, while user ratings are influenced by their contributions to the community, including up and down votes on comments. But what truly makes Reality Check News stand out is our geolocation-based rating system. Users closer to the source of a news event have a more significant impact on the content's visibility, creating a localized and personalized news experience.

Powered by the MERN stack and featuring cutting-edge GraphQL technology, Reality Check News is at the forefront of the digital news revolution. Join us today and be part of a community that values transparency, quality journalism, and the power of user-driven news.
